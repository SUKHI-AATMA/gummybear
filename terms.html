            <p class="sub">c. a reference to:</p>
            <p class="sub-l1">i. a party to this Agreement includes that partyâs permitted assigns; and </p>
            <p class="sub-l1">ii. including and similar words do not imply any limit.</p>
            <p>2 Obligations</p>
            <p>2.1 General: In addition to the other obligations of the Agreement:</p>
            <p class="sub">a. the Supplier must provide the Services:</p>
            <p class="sub-l1">i. in accordance with the Agreement, including any requirement set out in the Key Details, and all applicable laws;</p>

            <p class="sub">a. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Supplierâs warranties are limited to those stated in clause 3.1. Any implied condition or warranty (including any warranty under Part 3 of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017) is excluded </p>
            <p class="sub">b. The Client agrees and represents that it is acquiring the Services for the purposes of trade. The parties agree that: </p>
            <p class="sub-l1">i. to the maximum extent permissible by law, the New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 does not apply to the supply of the Services or the Agreement; and</p>
            <p class="sub-l1">ii. it is fair and reasonable that the parties are bound by this Agreement, including this clause 3.3. </p>
            <p>4 Intellectual Property</p>
            <p>4.1 Retained Intellectual Property: The following Intellectual Property (including any modification, enhancement or derivative work of that Intellectual Property) remains the property of the current owner, regardless of its use in the Services:</p>
            <p class="sub">a. Intellectual Property that existed prior to the date of the Agreement; and</p>
            <p class="sub">b. Intellectual Property that was developed independently of the Agreement.</p>
            <p>4.2 Know-how: To the extent not owned by the Supplier, the Client grants the Supplier a royalty- free, transferable, irrevocable and perpetual licence to use for the Supplierâs own business purposes any know-how, techniques, ideas, methodologies, and similar Intellectual Property used by the Supplier in the provision of the Services.</p>
            <p>4.3 Ownership going forward:</p>

            <p class="sub">c. The Client must pay the Supplierâs invoice:</p>
            <p class="sub-l1">i. by the 20th of the month following the date of invoice; and</p>
            <p class="sub-l1">ii. electronically in cleared funds without any set off or deduction.</p>
            <p>5.3 Overdue amounts: The Supplier may charge interest on overdue amounts. Interest will be calculated from the due date to the date of payment (both inclusive) at an annual percentage rate equal to the corporate overdraft reference rate (monthly charging cycle) applied by the Supplierâs primary trading bank as at the due date (or if the Supplierâs primary trading bank ceases to quote such a rate, then the rate which in the opinion of the bank is equivalent to that rate in respect of similar overdraft accommodation expressed as a percentage) plus a 2% per annum.</p>
            <p>6 Confidentiality</p>
            <p>6.1 Security: Each party agrees that, unless it has the prior written consent of the other party, it will:</p>

            <p class="sub">c. of Confidential Information which:</p>
            <p class="sub-l1">i. is publicly available through no fault of the recipient of the Confidential Information or its personnel; or</p>
            <p class="sub-l1">ii. was rightfully received from a third party without restriction and without breach of any obligation of confidentiality; or
                d by the Supplier if required as part of a bona fide sale of its business (assets or shares, whether in whole or in part) to a third party, provided that the Supplier enters into a confidentiality agreement with the third party on terms no less restrictive than this clause 6.</p>
            <p>6.3 Return of information: Except to the extent that a party has ongoing rights to use Confidential Information, a party must, at the request of the other party following the expiry or termination of the Agreement, promptly return to the other party or destroy all Confidential Information of the other party in the recipient partyâs possession or control.</p>

            <p>7.3 Unlimited liability:</p>
            <p class="sub">a. Clauses 7.1 and 7.2 do not apply to limit the Supplierâs liability for:</p>
            <p class="sub-l1">i. personal injury or death;</p>
            <p class="sub-l1">ii. fraud or wilful misconduct; or</p>
            <p class="sub-l1">iii. breach of clause 6.</p>

            <p>7.4 No liability for the otherâs failure: Neither party will be responsible, liable, or held to be in breach of the Agreement for any failure to perform its obligations under the Agreement or otherwise, to the extent the failure is directly caused by the other party failing to comply with its obligations under the Agreement, or by the negligence or misconduct of the other party or its personnel.</p>

            <p>8.3 Consequences of expiry or termination:</p>

            <p>9.3 Right to seek relief: This clause 9 does not affect either partyâs right to seek urgent interlocutory and/or injunctive relief.</p>
            <p>10 General Provisions</p>
            <p>10.1 Force Majeure: Neither party is liable to the other for any failure to perform its obligations under the Agreement to the extent caused by Force Majeure, provided that the affected party:</p>
            <p class="sub">a. immediately notifies the other party and provides full information about the Force Majeure;</p>
            <p class="sub">b. uses best endeavours to overcome the Force Majeure; and</p>
